# Week 02 – A+ Core 1 Exam Approaching and Home Lab Start

**Dates:** Started this Journal on December 11th, 2025

**Study Focus:**
- CompTIA A+ Core 1 - Virtualization, Mobile Devices, and Networking
- Home Lab Start
- Linux Journey Website Start

**Objectives:**
- Studying daily, aim to finish CompTIA A+ core 1 by the end of the week.
- Repair rediscovered old PC from 2005 that I found in my basement.
- Use repaired PC to begin home lab setup. It is unlikely that it would be super advanced, but it is a start, and a lesson in diagnostic.

**12/11/2025:**
- I found a PC in my parents' basement, and figured it would be a good use of my time to try to get it working.
- I opened it up and dusted it with compressed air, and having not been dusted in at least a decade, there was quite a bit caked up.
- After plugging it into a monitor using VGA, it failed to display anything. I also plugged in a keyboard and mouse, none of which indicated being powered, which suggests a POST issue.
- I also noticed an odd buzzing sound, and originally wrote it off as "maybe it's just a sound old PCs make". (I would later discover this was important)
- Steps Taken to Diagnose:
1. The first thing I did was unplug everything and open the PC again.
2. I plugged in only the power cable and, being careful to keep my hands clear, powered the PC on, which revealed that the internal fans were working fine.
3. I looked into the buzzing sound noted earlier, and discovered that it indicates that the GPU was likely not functional.
4. I took out and reslotted the GPU twice, once to test, and the second time after cleaning the pins with diluted isopropol alcohol and a microfiber cloth. Neither attempt worked.
5. I ordered a component online after ensuring that it would be compatible with the existing hardware. If this does not work, I will investigate further.

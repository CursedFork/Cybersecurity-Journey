# Week 01 – A+ Core 1 (Networking & Hardware)

**Why I am Doing This:**
I just recently made it very far in the application process for my first real tech job out after graduating in May, and throughout the interview process, I realized just how unprepared I really was.
This repository will act as my journal, representing my commitment to growth as a cybersecurity professional. 
I intend to put effort into studying for A+, Security+ and Network+ as I continue to work part time.
I also very recently discovered that my fiance is having a boy, so I am extra motivated to do the best I can to be a father my son can be proud of. 

**Dates:** Started this Journal on December 3rd, 2025

**Study Focus:**
- CompTIA A+ Core 1
- Materials Used This Week --> "CompTIA A+ Complete Review Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam 220-1102" by Troy McMillan

**Objectives:**
- Study vigorously with the objective of finishing off the A+ certificate by January.
- Write down and begin to memorize important port numbers and specific terms necessary for the job.
- Take at least 5 practice quizzes this week and record scores and notes taken from them.


**12/4/2025:**
- Began work in Textbook.
1. Took notes on the steps necessary to replace components in laptops including: Keyboards, SSDs/HDDs, Wireless Cards including: Bluetooth, 802.11, Mini PCIe, and Cellular Cards
2. Wrote down information which was marked as particularly significant on the exam, such as specific steps for replacing components and configuring biometric authentication
- Takeaway from the day: As long as there is reasonable familiarity with the inner workings of a laptop and the basic steps for disassembling and reassembling laptops, this section is reasonably basic
- Reflection: I believe more time should have been put into studying today; however, my shift at my part time job reduced the flexibility of my workday. Nonetheless, I feel like I am off to a good start
- Other Notes: I also downloaded an app for practice questions for the A+ exam, so hopefully, that will be helpful in gaining some experience answering relevant questions and keep me sharp.

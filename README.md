# Cyber Certification Journey

This repository tracks my progress studying for IT and cybersecurity certifications, including:

- CompTIA A+ (Core 1 & 2) -- Status: Passed Core 1, had no need for Core 2
- CompTIA Security+ -- Status: Had originally started studying for this, but was encouraged to skip straight to CySA+ by my employer 
- CompTIA CySA+ -- Status: Paid for by employer, completed chapter 3 as of 1/20/2026
- PECB-ISO27001 Lead Auditor -- Status: Paid for by employer, have not started
- Pentesting labs and exercises -- Most Recent Project: Pi-Hole on Raspberry Pi DHCP network-wide ad blocking

The goal of this journal is to document what I learn, reinforce understanding, and build a semi-professional portfolio of technical growth.

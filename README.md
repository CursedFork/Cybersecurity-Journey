# Cyber Certification Journey

This repository tracks my progress studying for IT and cybersecurity certifications, including:

- CompTIA A+ (Core 1 & 2)
- CompTIA Security+
- Pentesting labs and exercises

The goal of this journal is to document what I learn, reinforce understanding, and build a semi-professional portfolio of technical growth.

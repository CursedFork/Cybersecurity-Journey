**12/18/2025:**
- Since all of the parts arrived recently, I assembled them today to make a new, lightweight, simple PC for my brother.
- It is running Windows 11 on a used AMD Ryzen 5 (my old CPU), XFX series 570 GPU, 16 Gb of DDR4 RAM, 1 Tb of storage space on a 2.5" SSD, and a 650 Watt 80+ Gold Power Supply, with a motherboard that I bought as cheap as compatibly possible. 
- This setup should be more than enough for my brother since he claims to only want it for work purposes.
- I was able to bypass the step in setup connecting it to a microsoft account by pressing "f10+shift" during startup to open a terminal and entering: "start ms-cxh:localonly".
- This was done so that my brother would have the option of adding an account if desired, or leaving it as is.
- In other news, I landed a cybersecurity job!! I was very surprised, but delighted to hear from the company that brought me on, and will be starting early January, so unfortunately, no Geek Squad...
- I will be doing the polite thing and politely explaining that I will sadly be unable to fulfill the role, before they waste time on training me.
- I would not feel right making them take time away from doing their job to train me when I will be working a full time job that is incompatible with that work schedule in about two weeks.
- I will be continuing this journal, updating it with non-confidential work that I do, probably updates on Security+, since I no longer really need to continue A+. I will still be taking the core 1 exam though since I already paid for it.

**12/19/2025:**
- I did not do much this day, only really some final review for the Core 1 exam
---
**12/20/2025:**
- I passed the Core 1 exam!!
- With my first day on the job coming up, I will be pivoting towards Sec+ and other related work moving forward.

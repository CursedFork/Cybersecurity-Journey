# Week 02 – A+ Core 1 Exam Approaching and Home Lab Start

**Dates:** Started this Journal on December 11th, 2025

**Study Focus:**
- CompTIA A+ Core 1 - Virtualization, Mobile Devices, and Networking
- Home Lab Start
- Linux Journey Website Start

**Objectives:**
- Studying daily, aim to finish CompTIA A+ core 1 by the end of the week.
- Repair rediscovered old PC from 2005 that I found in my basement.
- Use repaired PC to begin home lab setup. It is unlikely that it would be super advanced, but it is a start, and a lesson in diagnostic.

**12/11/2025:**
- I found a PC in my parents' basement, and figured it would be a good use of my time to try to get it working.
- I opened it up and dusted it with compressed air, and having not been dusted in at least a decade, there was quite a bit caked up.
- After plugging it into a monitor using VGA, it failed to display anything. I also plugged in a keyboard and mouse, none of which indicated being powered, which suggests a POST issue.
- I also noticed an odd buzzing sound, and originally wrote it off as "maybe it's just a sound old PCs make". (I would later discover this was important)
- Steps Taken to Diagnose:
1. The first thing I did was unplug everything and open the PC again.
2. I plugged in only the power cable and, being careful to keep my hands clear, powered the PC on, which revealed that the internal fans were working fine.
3. I looked into the buzzing sound noted earlier, and discovered that it indicates that the GPU was likely not functional.
4. I took out and reslotted the GPU twice, once to test, and the second time after cleaning the pins with diluted isopropol alcohol and a microfiber cloth. Neither attempt worked.
5. I ordered a component online after ensuring that it would be compatible with the existing hardware. If this does not work, I will investigate further.

**12/12/2025:**
- I scheduled my CompTIA A+ Core 1 1201 exam for next Saturday, December 20th.
- My replacement GPU for the old PC is coming tomorrow.
- I did some more practice questions today and I am feeling reasonably confident about my upcoming exam.
- I signed up for a newsletter called "Tldr" which is supposed to give me daily news on technology, including cybersecurity, hardware, IT, and AI, based on how I set my preferences.

**12/13/2025:**
- The replacement GPU for my old PC project arrived today. However, in spite of being allegedly compatible it did not display anything on the screen. 
- Process:
1. I unplugged everything from the tower, and opened the PC. 
2. I removed the old GPU from the PCIe slot, and after taking the new GPU freshly out of its packaging, I slotted it in. 
3. I plugged in the power cable and turned it on. The PC still beeped, so I looked into further options. 
4. One suggestion I found was to clear the CMOS, so I followed the instructions I found and removed the battery from the motherboard and let it sit for 10 minutes, then put it back in. 
5. After plugging cables back in and turning the PC on again, there was no beeping and the keyboard received power sincd its lights came on. However, it did not display anything. 
6. I looked further into this issue and learned that even though it was technically compatible, Dell towers like the one I am working on do not support Display Port cables, which is the only connector type on the new GPU. 
7. I returned the new GPU and ordered one after ensuring it has the right connections. 
- After this situation, I got back to studying for my exam and took some practice quizzes and another practice exam.

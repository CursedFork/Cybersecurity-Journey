# Week 01 – A+ Core 1 (Networking & Hardware)

**Why I am Doing This:**
I just recently made it very far in the application process for my first real tech job out after graduating in May, and throughout the interview process, I realized just how unprepared I really was.
This repository will act as my journal, representing my commitment to growth as a cybersecurity professional. 
I intend to put effort into studying for A+, Security+ and Network+ as I continue to work part time.
I also very recently discovered that my fiance is having a boy, so I am extra motivated to do the best I can to be a father my son can be proud of. 

**Dates:** Started this Journal on December 3rd, 2025

**Study Focus:**
- CompTIA A+ Core 1

**Objectives:**
- Study vigorously with the objective of finishing off the A+ certificate by January
- Write down and begin to memorize important port numbers and specific terms necessary for the job
- Take at least 5 practice quizzes this week and record scores and notes taken from them

# Week 01 – A+ Core 1 (Networking & Hardware)

**Why I am Doing This:**
I just recently made it very far in the application process for my first real tech job out after graduating in May, and throughout the interview process, I realized just how unprepared I really was.
This repository will act as my journal, representing my commitment to growth as a cybersecurity professional. 
I intend to put effort into studying for A+, Security+ and Network+ as I continue to work part time.
I also very recently discovered that my fiance is having a boy, so I am extra motivated to do the best I can to be a father my son can be proud of. 

**Dates:** Started this Journal on December 3rd, 2025

**Study Focus:**
- CompTIA A+ Core 1
- Materials Used This Week --> "CompTIA A+ Complete Review Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam 220-1102" by Troy McMillan

**Objectives:**
- Study vigorously with the objective of finishing off the A+ certificate by January.
- Write down and begin to memorize important port numbers and specific terms necessary for the job.
- Take at least 5 practice quizzes this week and record scores and notes taken from them.


**12/4/2025:**
- Began work in Textbook.
1. Took notes on the steps necessary to replace components in laptops including: Keyboards, SSDs/HDDs, Wireless Cards including: Bluetooth, 802.11, Mini PCIe, and Cellular Cards
2. Wrote down information which was marked as particularly significant on the exam, such as specific steps for replacing components and configuring biometric authentication
- Takeaway from the day: As long as there is reasonable familiarity with the inner workings of a laptop and the basic steps for disassembling and reassembling laptops, this section is reasonably basic
- Reflection: I believe more time should have been put into studying today; however, my shift at my part time job reduced the flexibility of my workday. Nonetheless, I feel like I am off to a good start
- Other Notes: I also downloaded an app for practice questions for the A+ exam, so hopefully, that will be helpful in gaining some experience answering relevant questions and keep me sharp.

**12/5/2025:**
- Took practice quizzes for mobile devices. (Scored 86% on https://www.examcompass.com/comptia-a-plus-certification-practice-test-1-exam-220-1201).
- Weak areas included the specifics of certain acronyms, but I wrote down the questions I got wrong in my journal and made sure to correct myself.
- Takeaway from the day: Continuing practice and review seems to be working well.
- I also made use of that practice question app and scored reasonably well on the hardware section, but performed poorly on the networking section, which I will be studying tomorrow.

**12/6/2025:**
- Took notes on more of the book, and took time to take a couple general tests and practice quizzes
- I did not perform as well as I would have liked, only getting a 57% on my first test, my weaknesses were generally in areas I had not studied for previously
- This felt like a reasonable baseline, and I will be taking more in the coming days after I study the rest of the book
- Takeaway from the Day: I feel confident that I will be able to reach the goal I have set, to pass Core 1 of the exam within the next week or two. If I can maintain this momentum.
- Other Notes: I have been doing some research on relevant practice for cybersecurity and IT work, and I have two leads: pentesting practice websites such as hackthebox.com and using python to automate processes involving data collection of some kind. I was thinking about writing a script to skim over wikipedia pages and give me relevant information for movies I have seen as practice. 

**12/7/2025:**
- Discovered I made an error in judgement regarding my choice of book, a bit embarrassing, but I am making this record with everything I can included, especially mistakes.
- Essentially, while watching Professor Messer videos as a means of studying today, I discovered that the A+ exam is rewritten every ~3 years, and most recently in around March 2025.
- So, I restructured my study goals around the current standard, V15.
- I today, as a "catch-up" decided to put all of the topics into ChatGPT to get a general understanding of all of the topics for Core 1.
- I am planning to make flash cards tomorrow for all of the necessary ports and acronyms, and will be studying these at least twice a day.

**12/8/2025:**
- Took 8 pages of Cornell style notes for v15 of the exam.
- Covered the end of hardware and completed networking.
- All important definitions and acronyms from these sections are now recorded and defined alongside exam relevant information in my notes.
- Did 3 practice quizzes to end the day.

**12/9/2025:**
- Took 5 pages of Cornell style notes, with the objective of returning to them later to fill in the right column with more specific information.
- Covered Mobile Devices and Virtualization.
- Did 3 practice quizzes and a practice exam, with a noteworthy uptick in my score.
- My weaker areas are those which I have not already studied much, or in specific items which I have not yet memorized, which brings me to flashcards.
- I made a collection of 100 flashcards with important definitions, acronyms and port numbers.

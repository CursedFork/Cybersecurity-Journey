# Study Notes Repository

This repository is where I will be uploading my study notes as I work through different certifications and technical topics. The goal is to keep myself consistent, organized, and accountable throughout the process.

I will be uploading my physical notes every **Tuesday** until I pass the Core 1 and Core 2 exams and eventually the Security+ exam.
I will also include notes from future certifications as neeeded. However, for the moment, I am most focused on A+ and Security+.
These updates may include exam outlines, general notes for relevant topics, summaries, or anything else I’ve written down during the week.

This is mainly for my own tracking and review, but anyone is welcome to follow along or reference anything here if it helps.

I will also have flash cards, but I had no intention of uploading them.
If you are in need of flash cards, I recommend using Quizlet for online, but you can also gain a fair amount of retention from making physical versions.
